# Spell_Writer
A project meant to help teach python. It is a game where the enemy ai is already coded in and the player needs to write the player movement.
It was written for southern utah code camp 2017 by me and my friends. Recently ported to python 3.

To play first click on the playable characters to provide them with your python code. Then press enter to start the game. Example player files are given. Pressing R will reload the map.
